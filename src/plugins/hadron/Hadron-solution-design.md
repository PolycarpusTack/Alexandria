I understand now. I'll create a comprehensive project backlog for the Hadron - Crash File Analyzer application based on the MVP design document, while ensuring it follows the integration requirements from paste.txt, adheres to the coding guidelines, and is structured according to the backlog builder framework. This backlog will be designed specifically to avoid misinterpretation by AI during implementation.

Phase 1: Input Solution Design Analysis & Validation

1. Initial Read-Through & Understanding
   Overall goal: Create a Crash File Analyzer application that leverages locally deployed LLMs via Ollama to automate the analysis of software crash files, identify root causes, and suggest actionable solutions.
   Primary technology stack:
   Web Application Frontend (likely React/Vue/Angular SPA)
   Backend API (Python/FastAPI or Node.js/Express)
   PostgreSQL Database
   Local Ollama LLM Service
   File Storage (local filesystem or object storage)
   Key components:
   Web Application Frontend for user interaction
   Backend API for business logic and orchestration
   PostgreSQL Database for storing files, metadata, and analysis results
   Ollama LLM Service for crash analysis processing
   File storage for crash files
   Core user personas:
   Developers: Need to quickly understand crash causes and implement fixes
   System Administrators/SREs: Need to understand system-level crashes and stability issues
   QA Engineers: Need to provide detailed crash information and understand failures

2. Clarity Assessment
   The document doesn't specify the exact frontend framework, use the same as Core Alexandria application
   The specific model to use with Ollama is not specified - use dynamic live list pulled from running Ollama instance with manually triggered updates for model checks
   The document doesn't specify authentication mechanism details beyond "SAML/OIDC", simple account login based on mail/user/password
   Implement multi-layered file validation (e.g., size limits, malware scanning, content integrity checks, metadata validation, and compliance with regulations like GDPR/HIPAA), paired with clear user-facing error messages and asynchronous processing for resource-intensive tasks.
   Web Application Frontend: Medium Clarity (2) - Purpose and functionality clear but specific framework taken from Core Alexandria application
   Backend API: High Clarity (3) - Structure and responsibilities clearly defined
   Database: High Clarity (3) - Schema well-defined with entity relationships
   Ollama Integration: Medium Clarity (2) - General approach clear but specifics on prompt engineering not defined
   Overall Clarity: Medium to High (2.5) - Most key aspects are clear with some details needing elaboration
3. Business Context Validation
   Timeline and milestones determined by Claude
   Successful implementation is 90% clear file analysis with non-tech explanations
   Clarification needed: Is there a specific set of crash file formats that must be supported beyond the initial .txt, .log, .stacktrace? most filetypes, but priority to textbased files
   Clarification needed: What are the specific performance expectations when processing large crash files? Use the Enterprise_chunker available in the tools directory of the Core Alexandria app and integrate in the solution (C:/Projects/Alexandria/tools)
   Time to Resolution: reduction of 50%
4. Technical Feasibility Assessment
   Ollama LLM integration complexity (Medium Risk=2):
   Requires expertise in prompt engineering for technical crash analysis
   Performance of local LLM may vary based on hardware
   Mitigation: Start with well-defined prompt templates and benchmark on representative hardware
   Large file handling (Medium Risk=2):
   Crash dumps can be very large, potentially causing memory issues
   Mitigation: Implement streaming processing and pagination, use enterprise_chunker
   Authentication integration (Low Risk=1):
   Integration with corporate IdP requires configuration
   Mitigation: Follow established authentication patterns and thorough testing
   Scalability concerns:
   Ollama processing might be resource-intensive during concurrent analysis
   Consider implementation of processing queues for multiple concurrent users
   Need for efficient caching of analysis results
5. Regulatory Compliance Audit
   Data handling:
   Crash files may contain sensitive information like IP addresses, user identifiers, or system details
   Need for data encryption at rest (AES-256 as specified in NFRs)
   Access controls required for uploaded files and analysis results
   Audit logging needed for all critical actions
6. Security Threat Assessment
   Information disclosure in crash logs containing sensitive data
   Tampering risks for stored files and analysis results
   Repudiation concerns for user actions on critical files
   Denial of Service potential from processing very large files or multiple concurrent requests
   Dedicated security stories needed for:
   Input validation for all crash file uploads
   File content scanning
   Secure storage with proper encryption
   Access control implementation
   Audit logging
7. Context Window Optimization Assessment
   File processing logic may exceed context limitations for LLMs
   Recommend separating file validation, storage, and processing into distinct modules
   Ollama integration could be complex
   Separate prompt engineering from API interaction logic
   Database schema is well-structured but should be implemented in focused modules
8. Proceed/Hold Recommendation
   Proceeding with backlog generation. The Solution Design provides sufficient clarity for most areas, with reasonable assumptions possible for the areas needing more detail. Assumptions will be clearly documented in each section of the backlog.
