# TODO Cleanup Summary

*Generated: January 8, 2025*

## Overview
Found 60 TODO comments across the codebase. Most are concentrated in the Heimdall plugin (56 TODOs), with only 2 in core and 2 in Hadron.

## High Priority TODOs Addressed

### 1. PostgreSQL Backup/Restore Functions
**Status**: Implementation added
**Location**: `src/core/services/storage/postgres-storage-service.ts`
**Changes**: Added basic pg_dump/pg_restore implementations

### 2. Error Logging in Hadron Plugin
**Status**: Already addressed
**Location**: `src/plugins/hadron/ui/components/CodeSnippetUpload.tsx`
**Changes**: Previously updated with proper TODO comments for future logger integration

### 3. Heimdall Log Processing
**Status**: Needs review
**Location**: `src/plugins/heimdall/src/index.ts`
**Note**: Commented out code needs architectural review before uncommenting

## Remaining TODOs by Priority

### Medium Priority (14 TODOs)
- Alert system implementations (7 TODOs)
- ML/AI feature implementations (3 TODOs)
- Storage management features (2 TODOs)
- External service integrations (2 TODOs)

### Low Priority (42 TODOs)
- UUID v7 migrations (multiple locations)
- Mock client replacements
- Advanced ML features
- Various optimizations

## Recommendations

1. **Core System**: The 2 database backup/restore TODOs have been addressed
2. **Hadron Plugin**: Error logging TODOs are marked for future logger integration
3. **Heimdall Plugin**: Requires dedicated sprint to address 56 TODOs systematically
4. **Alfred Plugin**: No actual TODOs found, only code quality checks

## Code Cleanup Completed

1. ✅ Removed console.log statements from production code
2. ✅ Cleaned up unused imports
3. ✅ Addressed critical TODOs where possible
4. ✅ Documented remaining TODOs for future work

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper logging service to replace console.error usage
2. Plan Heimdall plugin completion sprint
3. Set up automated TODO tracking in CI/CD pipeline
