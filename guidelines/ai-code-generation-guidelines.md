# AI-Driven Development: Comprehensive Guidelines for Reliable Software Engineering

## Core Principles

* **Human-AI Collaboration**: AI serves as a co-pilot, not a replacement. Human expertise remains vital for complex reasoning, business understanding, and critical decisions.
* **Quality Assurance**: Maintain rigorous validation at every step. AI is a powerful assistant but requires oversight.
* **Test-Driven Development**: Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle religiously to prevent "magic code" that no one understands.
* **Atomic Tasks**: Break development into small, focused units of work for optimal AI assistance.
* **Continuous Verification**: Implement checks throughout the development cycle, not just at the end.
* **Documentation**: Document code, processes, and AI usage for transparency and traceability.

## 8-Step Workflow for AI-Driven Development

### Phase 1: Foundation and Scaffolding

#### 1. Kickoff - Defining Crystal-Clear Requirements
* ✅ **Draft a concise specification document** before engaging AI
  * Include what the application must do, inputs/outputs for each feature
  * Document non-functional requirements (performance, styling, etc.)
* ✅ **Use AI to help refine requirements**
  * Prompt: "Given these high-level requirements, identify any ambiguities or missing information"
  * Prompt: "Transform these notes into structured user stories following the format: 'As a [user], I want [action] so that [benefit]'"
* ✅ **Incorporate security requirements explicitly**
  * Include data protection, authentication, and authorization specifications
  * Prompt: "Given these requirements, what security considerations should we address?"
* ✅ **Validate requirements with human stakeholders**
  * AI can help identify gaps, but human approval is essential

#### 2. Project Skeleton & Tooling
* ✅ **Generate project scaffolding with AI**
  * Prompt: "Create a scaffold for a [framework] project named [name]. Include [linters], [formatters], and [test runner] configured with [specific settings]"
* ✅ **Set up development environment configurations**
  * Configure linters, formatters, and test runners with strict settings
  * Prompt: "Generate an ESLint configuration that enforces [specific rules]"
* ✅ **Pin dependency versions explicitly**
  * Lock all dependencies to specific versions to prevent drift
  * Prompt: "Update package.json to pin all dependencies to exact versions"
* ✅ **Generate containerization and environment configs**
  * Prompt: "Create a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for this project"
  * Prompt: "Generate a .env.example file with all required environment variables"
* ✅ **Establish CI/CD pipeline configuration**
  * Prompt: "Create a GitHub Actions workflow for testing and linting"

### Phase 2: Iterative Development

#### 3. Test-First Modules
* ✅ **Generate tests before implementation**
  * Prompt: "For the feature '[description]', write [test framework] tests covering: [scenario 1], [scenario 2], etc. Don't write implementation yet"
* ✅ **Include security-focused tests explicitly**
  * Prompt: "Write security tests for this authentication module, including tests for SQL injection, XSS vulnerabilities, and CSRF attacks"
* ✅ **Verify tests with human review**
  * Ensure tests cover all requirements, edge cases, and error scenarios
  * Confirm tests follow project-specific testing patterns and standards
* ✅ **Commit tests to version control before implementation**
  * Create a separate commit containing only tests
  * Let tests fail initially (Red phase)

#### 4. Implement Feature by Feature
* ✅ **Generate implementation to satisfy existing tests**
  * Prompt: "Implement the [function name] function so that all the above tests pass. Use [specific patterns/practices]"
* ✅ **Keep implementations focused and atomic**
  * One feature, function, or module at a time
  * Prompt: "Focus only on implementing this single function, don't modify any other code"
* ✅ **Refactor for cleanliness and performance**
  * Prompt: "Refactor this implementation to improve [readability/performance/etc.] while ensuring all tests still pass"
* ✅ **Review implementation carefully**
  * Check for security issues, performance problems, and adherence to standards
  * Verify implementation meets the original requirements

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance

#### 5. Continuous Integration in Prompt
* ✅ **Ask AI to simulate CI checks**
  * Prompt: "Given the full project so far, run all tests and lint checks; report any failures or style issues"
* ✅ **Address issues immediately**
  * Fix any reported issues before proceeding
  * Prompt: "Fix the linting issues you identified while maintaining the same functionality"
* ✅ **Supplement with real CI runs**
  * AI's simulated checks are not a replacement for actual CI pipeline runs
  * Maintain a parallel physical CI system that executes real tests and checks
* ✅ **Document any false positives or limitations**
  * Note cases where AI incorrectly flagged issues or missed actual problems

#### 6. End-to-End & Integration Testing
* ✅ **Generate integration tests across components**
  * Prompt: "Write integration tests that verify the interaction between the [component A] and [component B]"
* ✅ **Create E2E tests for complete user flows**
  * Prompt: "Write a [Playwright/Cypress] script that tests the entire user flow: [detailed flow description]"
* ✅ **Verify boundary conditions and error cases**
  * Test system behavior when components fail or return unexpected results
  * Prompt: "Generate tests for error scenarios when component [X] throws exceptions or returns errors"
* ✅ **Maintain test independence**
  * Ensure each test is self-contained and doesn't rely on the state from other tests

### Phase 4: Finalization

#### 7. Documentation & Final Checks
* ✅ **Generate comprehensive documentation**
  * Prompt: "Produce a README.md that explains how to install, run tests, and launch the app. Include code snippets"
  * Prompt: "Generate JSDoc comments for all public functions in this module"
* ✅ **Document architecture and design decisions**
  * Prompt: "Create an Architecture.md file explaining the high-level design, key components, and data flow"
* ✅ **Generate API documentation**
  * Prompt: "Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for these API endpoints"
* ✅ **Document AI usage transparently**
  * Record which parts of the code were AI-generated
  * Maintain a registry of effective prompts used during development

#### 8. Release-Ready Packaging
* ✅ **Prepare for deployment**
  * Prompt: "Update package.json to version [X.Y.Z], add a CHANGELOG.md summarizing completed features"
  * Prompt: "Generate a production build script with optimizations for [environment]"
* ✅ **Create deployment configurations**
  * Prompt: "Create deployment configuration for [cloud platform]"
  * Generate environment-specific settings for staging and production
* ✅ **Set up monitoring and observability**
  * Prompt: "Generate monitoring configuration for error tracking, performance metrics, and health checks"
* ✅ **Prepare rollback procedures**
  * Document steps for reverting to previous versions if issues arise
  * Prompt: "Create a rollback script for emergency version reversion"

#### 9. Post-Release Monitoring (Extended)
* ✅ **Set up dashboards and alerts**
  * Prompt: "Create a Grafana dashboard configuration for monitoring key metrics"
* ✅ **Implement error budgets and SLOs**
  * Define acceptable error rates and response times
  * Prompt: "Generate SLO definitions for this service including availability and latency targets"
* ✅ **Monitor for model/system drift**
  * Especially important for AI/ML components
  * Track performance metrics over time to detect degradation
* ✅ **Gather user feedback systematically**
  * Create mechanisms to collect and analyze user experiences
