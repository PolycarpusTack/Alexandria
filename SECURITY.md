We take the security of Alexandria Platform seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please email us at: `security@alexandria-platform.com`

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will perform an initial assessment within 7 days
- **Progress Updates**: We will provide regular updates every 7 days until resolution
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Responsible Disclosure

- Please give us reasonable time to fix the issue before any disclosure
- We will credit security researchers in our security advisories (with your permission)
- We may provide a bug bounty for qualifying vulnerabilities (case-by-case basis)

## Security Measures

### Code Security

- **Static Analysis**: All code is scanned with SonarQube and ESLint security rules
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated scanning with Snyk for known vulnerabilities
- **CodeQL Analysis**: GitHub's semantic code analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **License Compliance**: Automated license checking for legal compliance

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication with proper expiration
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permission system for users and plugins
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Joi schemas
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS attacks

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Secure Headers**: Helmet.js for security headers
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery protection
- **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries and ORM protection

### Infrastructure Security

- **HTTPS Only**: TLS 1.2+ required for all communications
- **Security Headers**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- **Container Security**: Minimal attack surface with Alpine Linux
- **Secret Management**: No hardcoded secrets, environment-based configuration

### Plugin Security

- **Sandboxed Execution**: Plugins run in isolated environments
- **Permission System**: Granular permissions with user approval
- **Code Review**: Manual review for plugin store submissions
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated security scanning for plugins

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

Ensure these security-related environment variables are properly configured:

```bash
# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=<strong-random-secret>
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# Database
DB_SSL=true
DB_ENCRYPT=true

# Security
HELMET_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
CSRF_ENABLED=true
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-domain.com

# Encryption
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-byte-hex-key>
HASH_ROUNDS=12
```
