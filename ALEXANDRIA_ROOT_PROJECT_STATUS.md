# ALEXANDRIA ROOT PROJECT STATUS
**Date**: 2025-06-11  
**Session**: Platform Startup Troubleshooting

## Executive Summary
The Alexandria platform startup was blocked by a root cause issue: Windows/WSL2 filesystem permission conflicts preventing proper node_modules installation. This is a known issue when running pnpm on Windows filesystem mounted in WSL.

## Current State

### ✅ Completed
1. **Environment Configuration** - .env file properly configured
2. **Workspace Package Structure** - Basic dist directories created for @alexandria/shared and @alexandria/ui-components
3. **TypeScript Setup** - ts-node and typescript are accessible via npx
4. **Vite Configuration** - Fixed platform.js import issue
5. **Server Code** - Backend can compile with ts-node when dependencies are available

### ❌ Blocking Issues
1. **ROOT CAUSE: WSL/Windows Filesystem Permissions**
   - Running on `/mnt/c/` causes permission errors during pnpm operations
   - 68+ temporary directories stuck in node_modules
   - pnpm cannot rename/move directories due to Windows file locking
   - Prevents installation of critical TypeScript type definitions

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - @types/express
   - @types/node
   - @types/cors
   - Other TypeScript definitions listed in package.json but not installed

3. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**
   - Cannot compile src/index.ts due to missing type definitions
   - Express types conflict between custom definitions and missing @types/express

## Root Cause Analysis
The project is located on Windows filesystem (`/mnt/c/Projects/Alexandria`) accessed through WSL2. This causes:
- File permission mismatches
- File locking issues during pnpm operations
- Incomplete dependency installations
- Temporary directories that cannot be cleaned

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Move to Linux Filesystem (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# Move project to WSL native filesystem
cp -r /mnt/c/Projects/Alexandria ~/alexandria
cd ~/alexandria
rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
```

### Option 2: Use Windows Terminal with pnpm
- Run pnpm commands from Windows PowerShell/CMD instead of WSL
- Keep development in WSL but manage dependencies from Windows side

### Option 3: Docker Development Environment
- Containerize the development environment to avoid filesystem issues

## Patterns Observed
1. This permission issue has occurred multiple times in the project history
2. Previous "fixes" were temporary workarounds, not root solutions
3. The issue always resurfaces when dependencies need updating

## Next Steps
1. **DECISION REQUIRED**: Choose filesystem strategy (Linux vs Windows)
2. Clean install dependencies in chosen environment
3. Verify all TypeScript types are properly installed
4. Start servers with verified dependency tree
5. Document the chosen approach for future developers

## Lessons Learned
- Always identify root causes, not symptoms
- WSL2 + Windows filesystem + pnpm = permission issues
- Node.js projects work best on native filesystems
- Quick fixes accumulate technical debt

## Commands Ready for Tomorrow
```bash
# If moving to Linux filesystem:
cp -r /mnt/c/Projects/Alexandria ~/alexandria
cd ~/alexandria
rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml .tsbuildinfo dist
pnpm install
./start-alexandria.sh

# If staying on Windows filesystem:
# Run from Windows Terminal (not WSL):
cd C:\Projects\Alexandria
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Session Notes
- Multiple attempts to fix symptoms rather than root cause
- User correctly identified pattern of "minimal fixes" vs "root fixes"
- Platform utilities (platform.js) created to support vite.config.mjs
- Alfred session helpers preserved (not removed) per conservative approach
- All changes focused on getting platform to start, not modifying functionality

## Things You Can Try Now (If You Want)

Since we're a team, here are some things you could try if you're interested:

### Quick Test from Windows Side
```powershell
# Open PowerShell or CMD in Windows (not WSL)
cd C:\Projects\Alexandria
pnpm install
# This might work because Windows has proper permissions for its own filesystem
```

### Or Test the Linux Filesystem Theory
```bash
# In WSL terminal
cp -r /mnt/c/Projects/Alexandria ~/alexandria-test
cd ~/alexandria-test
rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
# If this works without permission errors, we've confirmed the root cause
```

### Or Just Check What's Blocking
```bash
# See which processes might be locking files
lsof | grep Alexandria
# Or in Windows: Use Process Explorer to see what's holding handles
```

But honestly, you've already done a lot today too! These are just options if you're curious. We can definitely tackle it fresh tomorrow.
