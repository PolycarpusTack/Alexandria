# PNPM Migration and Code Cleanup Summary

*Completed: January 8, 2025*

## ‚úÖ PNPM Migration Status

### Completed Tasks:
1. **Migration Script Execution**
   - ‚úÖ Ran `pnpm-full-conversion.js` successfully
   - ‚úÖ Updated all package.json scripts from npm to pnpm
   - ‚úÖ Fixed typo: Changed "ppnpm" to "pnpm" in scripts
   - ‚úÖ Created optimized `.npmrc` for Windows compatibility
   - ‚úÖ Updated all batch files, PowerShell scripts, and shell scripts
   - ‚úÖ Created `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for monorepo support
   - ‚úÖ Removed `package-lock.json`

### Pending Tasks:
1. **Dependency Installation**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è `pnpm install` needs to be completed (was timing out)
   - Recommendation: Run `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` to regenerate lockfile
   - Alternative: Use `pnpm install --network-concurrency=4` for slower connections

2. **CI/CD Updates**
   - Need to update GitHub Actions or other CI/CD pipelines to use pnpm
   - Update deployment scripts to use pnpm commands

## ‚úÖ Code Cleanup Completed

### 1. Console.log Cleanup
**Files cleaned:** 4 files
- `src/plugins/alfred/src/index.ts` - Removed plugin lifecycle logs
- `src/client/components/ui/use-toast.tsx` - Removed mock implementation log
- `src/plugins/heimdall/ui/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Removed placeholder log
- `src/plugins/hadron/ui/components/CodeSnippetUpload.tsx` - Added TODO comments for future logger

### 2. Unused Imports Cleanup
**Files cleaned:** 3 files
- `src/client/App.tsx` - Removed: Button, Card, CCILayout
- `src/client/components/command-palette.tsx` - Removed: useState, Command
- `src/core/plugin-registry/plugin-registry.ts` - Removed: PluginPermission, uuidv4

### 3. TODO Comments Addressed
**Total TODOs found:** 60 (56 in Heimdall, 2 in Core, 2 in Hadron)

**Critical TODOs Fixed:**
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL backup/restore implementation in `postgres-storage-service.ts`
- ‚úÖ Error logging TODOs marked for future logger integration

**Remaining TODOs:**
- 14 Medium priority (alert systems, ML features, storage management)
- 42 Low priority (UUID v7 migrations, optimizations)

## üìã Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. Complete PNPM installation: `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`
2. Verify development server works: `pnpm dev`
3. Run tests: `pnpm test`

### Short Term:
1. Update CI/CD configurations for PNPM
2. Implement proper logging service to replace console.error
3. Plan Heimdall plugin completion sprint

### Long Term:
1. Address remaining medium priority TODOs
2. Set up automated code quality checks
3. Implement TODO tracking in CI/CD pipeline

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. **PNPM Installation fails:**
   ```bash
   pnpm store prune
   rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
   pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
   ```

2. **Build errors:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run fix-rollup
   pnpm run build
   ```

3. **Restore from backup:**
   - Backups are in `.npm-to-pnpm-backup/` directory

## Summary

The PNPM migration has been successfully prepared and partially executed. All scripts and configurations have been updated. The code cleanup has removed unnecessary console.logs, cleaned up unused imports, and addressed critical TODOs. The codebase is now cleaner and more maintainable.
