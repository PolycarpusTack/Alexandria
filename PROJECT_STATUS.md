- ✅ Crash log ingestion and parser
- ✅ Local LLM integration with Ollama
- ✅ Root cause analysis engine
- ✅ UI components for the plugin
  - ✅ Dashboard view
  - ✅ Log detail view
  - ✅ Upload interface
  - ✅ LLM status indicator
  - ✅ Analysis results visualization

### UI Implementation
- ✅ Modern component library with ShadCN UI

- ✅ Collapsible sidebar navigation
- ✅ Dashboard layout with cards and status indicators
- ✅ User profile and authentication integration
- ✅ Notifications system

### Project Configuration
- ✅ Package.json with dependencies
- ✅ TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Vite and build setup
- ✅ Tailwind CSS configuration
- ✅ Environment variables
- ✅ Jest and testing infrastructure

### Documentation
- ✅ README.md with instructions
- ✅ "Files for Dummies" documentation for key files
- ✅ CLAUDE.md for context memory
- ✅ Manual Test Plan documentation
- ✅ Project structure documentation

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- Strong separation of concerns with a clean architecture
- Comprehensive error handling in core services
- Well-defined interfaces with proper TypeScript usage
- UI follows accessibility best practices
- Event-driven communication pattern implemented consistently
- Robust plugin lifecycle management

### Areas for Improvement
- Test coverage needs expansion, especially for edge cases
- More comprehensive documentation for complex services
- Complete PostgreSQL schema implementation
- Improve error handling in UI components
- Add more comprehensive integration tests

## Next Steps

- ⬜ Log Visualization Plugin
- ⬜ AI-Driven Ticket Analysis Plugin
- ⬜ Intelligent Knowledge Base (RAG) Plugin

### Integration & Workflows (EPIC 4)
- ⬜ Cross-Plugin Workflow: Ticket-to-Resolution
- ⬜ Proactive Customer Communication Workflow
- ⬜ AI-Powered Support Dashboard

### Documentation & Knowledge Transfer (EPIC 5)
- ⬜ Complete Platform Technical Documentation
- ⬜ Plugin Documentation & User Guides
- ⬜ Comprehensive "Files for Dummies" Documentation

### Platform Deployment & Operations (EPIC 6)
- ⬜ Containerization & Environment Setup
- ⬜ Monitoring & Observability Implementation
- ⬜ CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## Known Issues
- Node.js permissions issue on Windows when running `npm install`
- Some UI components need real data integration
- Ollama integration needs to be tested with actual Ollama instance
- Test coverage needs to be increased, currently focused on core services and UI components
- TypeScript module resolution error with ESM imports (see CLAUDE.md for details)

## Development Environment
- Node.js v16+ required
- PostgreSQL 14+ (optional, for persistent data storage)
- Ollama for LLM functionality
- NPM for package management
- Development server runs on port 3000
- Backend API on port 4000

## How to Continue Development
1. Resolve any environment setup issues
2. Run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to start the development server
3. For PostgreSQL data persistence, set `USE_POSTGRES=true` in your `.env` file and configure the PostgreSQL connection options
4. Pick the next EPIC or task from the list above
5. Follow the architecture patterns established in the existing code
6. Adhere to the coding guidelines in CLAUDE.md
