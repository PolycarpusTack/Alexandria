## Files to Create/Modify
- `src/api/v1/` and `src/api/v2/` (versioned APIs)
- `src/store/` (state management)
- `src/components/ui/` (component library)
- `docs/ADRs/` (architecture decisions)
- `packages/ui-components/` (shared component library)
- `vite.config.ts` (consolidated build)
- `packages/shared/` (shared utilities)

## Architecture Patterns to Implement
- [ ] Hexagonal Architecture for core business logic
- [ ] Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) for complex operations
- [ ] Event Sourcing for audit trails and state reconstruction
- [ ] Microkernel pattern for plugin architecture
- [ ] Repository pattern for data access abstraction

## Code Check-up Protocol (After Each Architecture Change)
1. **Architecture Validation:** Verify adherence to chosen patterns
2. **Performance Impact:** Measure performance impact of changes
3. **Maintainability Check:** Assess code maintainability improvements
4. **Integration Testing:** Verify all components work together
5. **Documentation Update:** Ensure documentation reflects changes

## Technical Debt Check-up Protocol (After Each Section)
1. **Architecture Metrics:**
   - Measure cyclomatic complexity reduction
   - Track code duplication percentage
   - Monitor coupling and cohesion metrics
   - Assess maintainability index improvements

2. **Debt Score Tracking:**
   - Core System: Target 4/10 (from 8/10)
   - Plugin System: Target 3/10 (from 7/10)
   - UI Components: Target 2/10 (from 5/10)
   - API Layer: Target 2/10 (from 7/10)

3. **Quality Gates:**
   - Code duplication <5%
   - All APIs versioned and documented
   - Component reusability >80%
   - Build time <2 minutes

## Success Criteria
- All APIs properly versioned with backward compatibility
- Centralized state management eliminates prop drilling
- Reusable component library with 80%+ adoption
- Code duplication reduced to <5%
- Build process consolidated and optimized
- Dependencies up-to-date and security-scanned
- Python integration clearly defined and documented
- CSS architecture consistent and maintainable
- Comprehensive documentation and ADRs

## Migration Strategy
