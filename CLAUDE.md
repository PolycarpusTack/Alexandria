# CLAUDE.md - Essential Guide for Working with Alexandria

## üö® TOP 5 NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES - MUST READ FIRST

1. **NEVER REPLACE COMPLEX COMPONENTS WITH SIMPLIFIED VERSIONS** ‚Äî Always fix the actual problem in existing code, never create a "simplified" replacement.

2. **ALWAYS FIX ROOT CAUSES** ‚Äî Diagnose and address the underlying issue, don't create workarounds or patches that mask it.

3. **WHEN REQUIREMENTS ARE AMBIGUOUS, ASK FOR CLARIFICATION** ‚Äî If any part of the request is unclear, always ask specific questions rather than making assumptions.

4. **CODE MUST EXACTLY MATCH REQUIREMENTS** ‚Äî Implement precisely what was requested, no extra features, no altered behavior unless explicitly approved.

5. **EVERY FUNCTION MUST HANDLE ERRORS AND EDGE CASES** ‚Äî No exceptions. All code must validate inputs, handle errors gracefully, and consider edge conditions.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember: When in doubt, ASK. It's always better to clarify requirements than to make incorrect assumptions.**

## Repository Overview

The Alexandria repository serves two primary purposes:

1. **Collection of Advanced Prompt Engineering Templates** designed for AI-assisted content generation:

   - Software architecture design (Alexandria_Plan)
   - API documentation generation (ULTIMATE API DOCUMENTATION GENERATOR)
   - Code explanation templates (Files For Dummies)
   - Educational content creation (Ultimate Zero-to-Hero Textbook Generator)
   - AI programming guidelines (Ultimate AI Coding Guidelines)

2. **Modular AI-Enhanced Customer Care Platform** - An enterprise application being actively developed:

   - Follows microkernel architecture with plugin system
   - Includes the Crash File Analyzer application as a core plugin
   - Built with modern web technologies (React, TypeScript, ShadCN UI components)

## Working with this Repository

### Core Development Principles

1. **Follow Microkernel Architecture**: Maintain strict separation of core and plugin functionalities
2. **Event-Driven Communication**: Use the event bus for cross-component communication
3. **Strong Typing**: Leverage TypeScript for type safety throughout the codebase
4. **Plugin Lifecycle**: Follow the proper lifecycle hooks for plugins (install, activate, deactivate, uninstall)
5. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with context-rich information
