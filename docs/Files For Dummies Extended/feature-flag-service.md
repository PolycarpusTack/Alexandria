# üìù Feature Flag Service - "For Dummies" Code Walk-through

## üìÇ 1. File Snapshot & Quick Facts

1. **Filename & Purpose** ‚Äì `src/core/feature-flags/feature-flag-service.ts` implements a feature flag system to control feature availability and plugin activation dynamically.
    
2. **Language & Version** ‚Äì TypeScript 5.3.
    
3. **Runtime / Framework** ‚Äì Node.js 18+, part of the Alexandria platform's microkernel architecture.
    
4. **Prerequisites** ‚Äì Winston for logging, UUID for ID generation, and an Event Bus implementation.
    
5. **How to Execute/Test** ‚Äì ```const flagService = new FeatureFlagServiceImpl(logger, eventBus); await flagService.initialize(); const isEnabled = await flagService.isEnabled('feature.name');```
    

## üßê 2. Bird's-Eye Flow Diagram

The Feature Flag Service flow:
1. Initialize with default flags
2. Client code requests if a feature is enabled via `isEnabled()`
3. Service checks for overrides matching the context
4. If no override, evaluates flag rules in sequence
5. If no rule matches, returns the default value
6. Results are cached for performance
7. Changes to flags trigger events for system-wide notification

The service provides both feature control (enabling/disabling features) and segmentation (enabling features for specific users or groups).

## üîç 3. The Line-by-Line / Chunk-by-Chunk Breakdown

### Lines 1-9

```typescript
import { 
  FeatureFlagService, 
  FeatureFlag, 
  FlagContext, 
  FlagRule, 
  FlagOverride, 
  FlagAuditLogEntry, 
  FlagEvaluationResult 
} from './interfaces';
import { Logger } from '../../utils/logger';
import { EventBus } from '../event-bus/interfaces';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Imports interfaces and dependencies needed for the feature flag service.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì Defines the shape of the data and provides access to logging, event bus, and UUID generation.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì It's like gathering all your cooking tools and recipe card before starting to cook.  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì TypeScript would show errors for undefined types, and functionality would be missing.  
**Extra nerd-notes** ‚Äì Using well-defined interfaces provides strong typing and makes the code more maintainable.

### Lines 11-21

```typescript
/**
 * In-memory implementation of the Feature Flag Service
 * 
 * This class provides a service for controlling feature flags and plugin activation.
 * It manages feature flag definitions, evaluates flags based on context, and tracks
 * flag changes through audit logs.
 */
export class FeatureFlagServiceImpl implements FeatureFlagService {
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Declares the main feature flag service class and documents its purpose.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì Establishes the entry point for all feature flag operations and clarifies its role.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì It's like the cover of an instruction manual that tells you what's inside.  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì The class wouldn't be exportable or its purpose would be unclear to other developers.

### Lines 22-33

```typescript
  private flags: Map<string, FeatureFlag> = new Map();
  private overrides: Map<string, FlagOverride[]> = new Map();
  private auditLogs: FlagAuditLogEntry[] = [];
  private cache: Map<string, { value: boolean; expiresAt: number }> = new Map();
  private logger: Logger;
  private eventBus: EventBus;
  private isInitialized: boolean = false;
  
  // Cache configuration
  private readonly CACHE_TTL_MS = 60 * 1000; // 1 minute
  private readonly DEFAULT_CONTEXT_KEY = '__default__';
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Declares private properties for storing flags, overrides, logs, cache, and configuration.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì Creates the internal state and tools the service will use to function.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì It's like setting up a filing cabinet with different drawers for different types of documents.  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì The service would lose its ability to store flags or track changes over time.  
**Extra nerd-notes** ‚Äì Using Maps provides efficient lookup by key. The cache helps prevent repeated evaluations of the same flags.

### Lines 35-38

```typescript
  constructor(logger: Logger, eventBus: EventBus) {
    this.logger = logger;
    this.eventBus = eventBus;
  }
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Initializes the service with required dependencies.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì Provides logging and event publishing capabilities to the service.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì It's like hiring a secretary (logger) and a messenger (eventBus) for your office.  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì The service wouldn't be able to log activities or notify other systems about changes.

### Lines 40-67

```typescript
  /**
   * Initialize the feature flag service
   */
  async initialize(): Promise<void> {
    if (this.isInitialized) {
      throw new Error('Feature flag service is already initialized');
    }
    
    this.logger.info('Initializing feature flag service', { component: 'FeatureFlagService' });
    
    try {
      // In a real implementation, this would load flags from a database
      // For this example, we'll create some default flags
      await this.createDefaultFlags();
      
      // Start cache cleanup interval
      setInterval(() => this.cleanupCache(), 5 * 60 * 1000); // Clean up every 5 minutes
      
      this.isInitialized = true;
      
      this.logger.info('Feature flag service initialized successfully', { component: 'FeatureFlagService' });
    } catch (error) {
      this.logger.error('Failed to initialize feature flag service', {
        component: 'FeatureFlagService',
        error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)
      });
      
      throw new Error(`Failed to initialize feature flag service: ${error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)}`);
    }
  }
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Sets up the feature flag service with default flags and cache maintenance.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì Ensures the service is ready to use with initial configuration and prevents double initialization.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì It's like starting a restaurant by setting up the kitchen, creating a menu, and scheduling regular cleaning.  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì The service would start without default flags, or might be initialized multiple times causing unpredictable behavior.  
**Extra nerd-notes** ‚Äì Uses a try-catch block for robust error handling, and logs the outcome either way. The periodic cleanup prevents memory leaks.

### Lines 69-101

```typescript
  /**
   * Check if a feature is enabled
   */
  async isEnabled(key: string, context: FlagContext = {}): Promise<boolean> {
    try {
      const cacheKey = this.getCacheKey(key, context);
      
      // Check cache first
      const cached = this.cache.get(cacheKey);
      if (cached && Date.now() < cached.expiresAt) {
        return cached.value;
      }
      
      // Evaluate flag
      const result = await this.evaluateFlag(key, context);
      
      // Cache result
      this.cache.set(cacheKey, {
        value: result.value,
        expiresAt: Date.now() + this.CACHE_TTL_MS
      });
      
      return result.value;
    } catch (error) {
      this.logger.error(`Error evaluating feature flag "${key}"`, {
        component: 'FeatureFlagService',
        error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error),
        context
      });
      
      return false; // Default to disabled on error
    }
  }
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Determines if a feature is enabled for a given context with caching for performance.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì This is the primary method clients will call to check if a feature should be active.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì It's like a bouncer checking if someone is on the VIP list, with a memory of recent visitors to speed up repeat checks.  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì Applications couldn't check feature status, or would do so inefficiently without caching.  
**Extra nerd-notes** ‚Äì Follows a "fail-safe" approach by returning false (disabled) if anything goes wrong, preventing a crash from enabling restricted features.

### Lines 103-117

```typescript
  /**
   * Get all feature flags
   */
  async getAllFlags(): Promise<FeatureFlag[]> {
    return Array.from(this.flags.values());
  }

  /**
   * Get a specific feature flag
   */
  async getFlag(key: string): Promise<FeatureFlag | null> {
    return this.flags.get(key) || null;
  }
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Provides methods to retrieve all flags or a specific flag.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì Allows admin interfaces to display and manage the current flag configuration.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì It's like having a "show menu" command at a restaurant to see all available dishes.  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì Admin tools couldn't display the current flag configuration.  
**Extra nerd-notes** ‚Äì Converting a Map to Array requires `Array.from(map.values())` to get the values, rather than map entries.

### Lines 119-172

```typescript
  /**
   * Create a new feature flag
   */
  async createFlag(flag: Omit<FeatureFlag, 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt'>, createdBy: string): Promise<FeatureFlag> {
    if (this.flags.has(flag.key)) {
      throw new Error(`Feature flag with key "${flag.key}" already exists`);
    }
    
    const now = new Date();
    const newFlag: FeatureFlag = {
      ...flag,
      createdAt: now,
      updatedAt: now
    };
    
    // Validate flag
    this.validateFlag(newFlag);
    
    // Store flag
    this.flags.set(newFlag.key, newFlag);
    
    // Create audit log entry
    const auditLog: FlagAuditLogEntry = {
      id: uuidv4(),
      key: newFlag.key,
      action: 'CREATE',
      newState: newFlag,
      performedBy: createdBy,
      timestamp: now
    };
    
    this.auditLogs.push(auditLog);
    
    // Publish event
    await this.eventBus.publish('featureFlags.created', {
      key: newFlag.key,
      flag: newFlag,
      createdBy
    });
    
    this.logger.info(`Created feature flag "${newFlag.key}"`, {
      component: 'FeatureFlagService',
      createdBy
    });
    
    return newFlag;
  }
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Creates a new feature flag, validates it, logs the creation, and notifies via events.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì Provides a safe way to add new feature flags with all necessary validation and recording.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì It's like adding a new product to your store, checking it meets quality standards, adding it to inventory, and announcing it to your staff.  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì New flags couldn't be created, or might be created without validation or notification.  
**Extra nerd-notes** ‚Äì The `Omit<FeatureFlag, 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt'>` type allows the caller to omit timestamp fields while requiring all other fields. The service adds timestamps automatically.

### Lines 174-228

```typescript
  /**
   * Update an existing feature flag
   */
  async updateFlag(key: string, updates: Partial<FeatureFlag>, updatedBy: string): Promise<FeatureFlag> {
    // Implementation details...
  }
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Updates an existing flag with new properties, validates changes, and records the update.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì Allows changing flag configuration safely with tracking and notification.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì It's like modifying a recipe in your cookbook, making sure it still works, and noting who changed it and when.  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì Flags couldn't be modified after creation, reducing flexibility.  
**Extra nerd-notes** ‚Äì Using `Partial<FeatureFlag>` allows updating only some properties while leaving others unchanged.

### Lines 230-278

```typescript
  /**
   * Delete a feature flag
   */
  async deleteFlag(key: string, deletedBy: string): Promise<boolean> {
    // Implementation details...
  }
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Deletes a flag (if not marked permanent) and records the deletion.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì Allows removing unused flags to keep the system clean, with safety checks and audit trail.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì It's like retiring a menu item from a restaurant, making sure nobody can order it anymore.  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì Unused flags would accumulate over time, cluttering the system.  
**Extra nerd-notes** ‚Äì The permanent flag option prevents accidental deletion of critical system flags.

### Lines 280-359

```typescript
  /**
   * Set an override for a feature flag
   */
  async setOverride(override: Omit<FlagOverride, 'createdAt'>, createdBy: string): Promise<FlagOverride> {
    // Implementation details...
  }
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Creates or updates an override that forces a flag to a specific value for a context.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì Allows exceptions to the normal flag rules for specific users, test environments, etc.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì It's like giving a VIP pass to specific guests, letting them bypass the normal entry requirements.  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì The system would be less flexible, requiring rule changes instead of temporary overrides.  
**Extra nerd-notes** ‚Äì Overrides are checked first in evaluation, taking precedence over normal rules. They can be targeted to specific contexts or global.

### Lines 361-427

```typescript
  /**
   * Remove an override for a feature flag
   */
  async removeOverride(key: string, context: Partial<FlagContext> | undefined, removedBy: string): Promise<boolean> {
    // Implementation details...
  }

  /**
   * Get all overrides for a feature flag
   */
  async getOverrides(key: string): Promise<FlagOverride[]> {
    return this.overrides.get(key) || [];
  }

  /**
   * Get audit logs for a feature flag
   */
  async getAuditLogs(key: string, limit?: number, offset?: number): Promise<FlagAuditLogEntry[]> {
    // Implementation details...
  }
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Provides methods to manage overrides and retrieve audit logs.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì Completes the override lifecycle and provides transparency into flag changes.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì It's like having commands to revoke special passes and check the history of who entered your venue.  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì Overrides couldn't be removed once set, and administrators couldn't track changes.

### Lines 429-536

```typescript
  /**
   * Evaluate a feature flag with full result
   */
  async evaluateFlag(key: string, context: FlagContext = {}): Promise<FlagEvaluationResult> {
    // Get flag
    const flag = this.flags.get(key);
    
    if (!flag) {
      return {
        key,
        value: false,
        reason: 'ERROR',
        errorMessage: `Feature flag "${key}" not found`
      };
    }
    
    try {
      // Update last evaluated timestamp
      flag.lastEvaluatedAt = new Date();
      
      // Check overrides first
      const override = await this.findMatchingOverride(key, context);
      if (override) {
        return {
          key,
          value: override.value,
          reason: 'OVERRIDE'
        };
      }
      
      // Check dependencies
      if (flag.dependencies && flag.dependencies.length > 0) {
        for (const dependency of flag.dependencies) {
          const depResult = await this.isEnabled(dependency.key, context);
          if (depResult !== dependency.value) {
            return {
              key,
              value: false, // If dependency doesn't match, disable feature
              reason: 'DEPENDENCY'
            };
          }
        }
      }
      
      // Evaluate rules
      for (let i = 0; i < flag.rules.length; i++) {
        const rule = flag.rules[i];
        
        // Skip inactive rules
        if (!rule.active) {
          continue;
        }
        
        // Check if rule matches
        if (this.doesRuleMatch(rule, context)) {
          return {
            key,
            value: rule.value,
            reason: 'RULE',
            ruleIndex: i
          };
        }
      }
      
      // No rules matched, return default value
      return {
        key,
        value: flag.defaultValue,
        reason: 'DEFAULT'
      };
    } catch (error) {
      // Log and return error result
      // ...
    }
  }
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Evaluates a flag for a given context, checking overrides, dependencies, and rules in sequence.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì This is the core logic that determines whether a feature is enabled, with detailed reasons.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì It's like a judge going through a checklist to decide if someone can enter a restricted area: "Are they on the VIP list? Do they meet all requirements? Do they match any specific rule?"  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì The entire feature flag system would fail to work correctly, as this is its core function.  
**Extra nerd-notes** ‚Äì The evaluation sequence is important: overrides ‚Üí dependencies ‚Üí rules ‚Üí default value. This provides a clear precedence order.

### Lines 538-558

```typescript
  /**
   * Evaluate multiple feature flags at once
   */
  async evaluateFlags(keys: string[], context: FlagContext = {}): Promise<Record<string, FlagEvaluationResult>> {
    const results: Record<string, FlagEvaluationResult> = {};
    
    // Evaluate each flag in parallel
    const evaluations = keys.map(key => this.evaluateFlag(key, context));
    const evaluationResults = await Promise.all(evaluations);
    
    // Process results
    for (let i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {
      results[keys[i]] = evaluationResults[i];
    }
    
    return results;
  }
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Evaluates multiple flags in parallel for efficiency.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì Allows batch checking of many flags at once, reducing overhead.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì Instead of checking guests one by one, it's like having multiple bouncers checking different people simultaneously.  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì Applications needing to check multiple flags would have to do so sequentially, increasing latency.  
**Extra nerd-notes** ‚Äì Uses `Promise.all` for parallelization, which can significantly improve performance when checking many flags.

### Lines 560-593

```typescript
  /**
   * Get feature flags for a plugin
   */
  async getFlagsForPlugin(pluginId: string): Promise<FeatureFlag[]> {
    const flags: FeatureFlag[] = [];
    
    for (const flag of this.flags.values()) {
      if (flag.plugins && flag.plugins.includes(pluginId)) {
        flags.push(flag);
      }
    }
    
    return flags;
  }

  /**
   * Check if a plugin should be activated based on feature flags
   */
  async shouldActivatePlugin(pluginId: string, context: FlagContext = {}): Promise<boolean> {
    const flags = await this.getFlagsForPlugin(pluginId);
    
    // If no flags control this plugin, default to activated
    if (flags.length === 0) {
      return true;
    }
    
    // Check if all flags are enabled
    for (const flag of flags) {
      const isEnabled = await this.isEnabled(flag.key, context);
      if (!isEnabled) {
        return false;
      }
    }
    
    return true;
  }
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Provides methods to find flags associated with a plugin and determine if a plugin should be active.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì Enables the Alexandria platform's plugin architecture by controlling plugin activation.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì It's like checking if all required permits are approved before allowing construction to begin.  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì The platform's plugin system would lose its dynamic control capabilities.  
**Extra nerd-notes** ‚Äì The plugin activation requires all associated flags to be enabled (AND logic) - if any flag is disabled, the plugin is disabled.

### Lines 595-671

```typescript
  /**
   * Check if a rule matches the given context
   */
  private doesRuleMatch(rule: FlagRule, context: FlagContext): boolean {
    // Implementation details...
  }

  /**
   * Evaluate a condition against a context
   */
  private evaluateCondition(condition: FlagRule['conditions'][0], context: FlagContext): boolean {
    // Implementation details...
  }
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Provides the logic to match rules and conditions against a context.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì This is how the system determines if a rule applies to a given user/environment.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì It's like checking if someone matches the "Must be this tall to ride" sign at an amusement park.  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì Rules wouldn't be evaluated correctly, breaking targeting functionality.  
**Extra nerd-notes** ‚Äì Supports many comparison operators like equality, greater/less than, contains, regex patterns, etc. for flexible targeting.

### Lines 673-697

```typescript
  /**
   * Check if a user is in a percentage range
   */
  private isInPercentageRange(percentage: number, context: FlagContext): boolean {
    // Implementation details...
  }
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Implements percentage-based rollouts by deterministically mapping users to a 0-100 range.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì Enables gradual feature rollouts to a percentage of users.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì It's like a lottery where your ticket number consistently determines whether you win, ensuring the same users always get the same result.  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì Gradual rollouts would be impossible, forcing all-or-nothing feature launches.  
**Extra nerd-notes** ‚Äì Uses a hash of user ID (or context) to ensure consistent results for the same user, avoiding a random experience.

### Lines 699-827

```typescript
  /**
   * Find a matching override for a flag and context
   */
  private async findMatchingOverride(key: string, context: FlagContext): Promise<FlagOverride | undefined> {
    // Implementation details...
  }

  /**
   * Check if a context matches an override context
   */
  private doesContextMatch(userContext: FlagContext, overrideContext?: Partial<FlagContext>): boolean {
    // Implementation details...

    // Implementation details...
  }

  /**
   * Clear cache entries for a specific flag
   */
  private clearFlagCache(key: string): void {
    // Implementation details...
  }

  /**
   * Clean up expired cache entries
   */
  private cleanupCache(): void {
    // Implementation details...
  }
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Implements override matching, cache management, and context matching logic.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì These helper methods power the core functionality with sophisticated matching and performance optimization.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì These are like the behind-the-scenes workers at a theme park, making sure the right people get on the right rides quickly.  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì Overrides wouldn't match correctly, cache would grow unbounded, or context matching would fail.  
**Extra nerd-notes** ‚Äì The specificity concept ensures that more specific overrides (e.g., for a specific user) take precedence over more general ones (e.g., for all users in a group).

### Lines 829-950

```typescript
  /**
   * Validate a feature flag
   */
  private validateFlag(flag: FeatureFlag): void {
    // Implementation details...
  }

  /**
   * Check for circular dependencies
   */
  private checkCircularDependencies(flagKey: string, dependencies: string[], visited: Set<string>): void {
    // Implementation details...
  }

  /**
   * Create default flags for the system
   */
  private async createDefaultFlags(): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation details...
  }
```

**What it does** ‚Äì Provides validation, dependency checking, and default flag creation.  
**Why it matters** ‚Äì Ensures flags are valid, prevents circular dependencies, and sets up initial system flags.  
**ELI5 Analogy** ‚Äì It's like the safety inspector and initial setup crew for the theme park, making sure everything is safe and ready for opening day.  
**If you changed/removed it‚Ä¶** ‚Äì Invalid flags might be created, circular dependencies could cause infinite loops, or the system would start without default flags.  
**Extra nerd-notes** ‚Äì The circular dependency check uses a depth-first search with a visited set to detect cycles efficiently.

## üìà 4. Pulling It All Together

1. **Execution Timeline** ‚Äì When the service initializes, it creates default flags and sets up cache maintenance. When clients check if a feature is enabled, the service checks the cache first, then evaluates by checking overrides, dependencies, and rules in sequence, returning the result and updating the cache. When flags are modified, events are published to notify the system.
    
2. **Data Lifecycle**:
   - Flags are created, updated, and occasionally deleted over time
   - Evaluation results are cached for performance and expire after 1 minute
   - Audit logs accumulate as flags change, creating a historical record
   - Overrides can be temporary (with expiration) or permanent
   - Cache is periodically cleaned to prevent memory bloat
    
3. **Control Flow Gotchas**:
   - Circular dependencies in flags will cause validation errors
   - Permanent flags cannot be deleted
   - Cache means changes may take up to 1 minute to propagate

## üö© 5. Common Pitfalls & Debugging Tips

- **Frequent Errors**: 
  - "Flag key already exists" when creating a flag with an existing key
  - "Flag not found" when referencing a non-existent flag
  - "Circular dependency detected" when flags form a dependency loop

- **IDE Breakpoint Suggestions**: 
  - Place breakpoints in `evaluateFlag` to debug flag evaluation issues
  - Check `doesRuleMatch` and `evaluateCondition` for rule matching problems
  - Monitor `findMatchingOverride` if overrides aren't working as expected
    
- **Logging Hints**: 
  - Enable debug logging to see cache operations and rule evaluations
  - Watch for "Evaluating feature flag" logs to track behavior
  - Check the audit logs for a history of changes

## ‚úÖ 6. Best Practices & Refactoring Nuggets

- The service uses caching to improve performance - critical for frequently checked flags
- The in-memory implementation should be replaced with a persistent database store in production
- Consider adding TTL (time-to-live) for flags themselves, not just overrides
- Add metrics collection to track flag usage and evaluation performance
- Implement a scheduled job to clean up unused or stale flags
- Consider implementing A/B testing capabilities by extending the percentage-based rollout

## üìö 7. Glossary (Jargon-Buster)

| Term | Plain-English Meaning | Why It Matters Here |
|---|---|---|
| "Feature Flag" | A toggle that controls whether a feature is active | The core concept of the entire service |
| "Override" | A special rule that takes precedence over normal evaluation | Allows exceptions and targeted enabling/disabling of features |
| "Context" | Information about the current user, environment, etc. | Used to determine which users get which features |
| "Rule" | A condition that determines when a flag is on or off | Enables sophisticated targeting and gradual rollouts |
| "Rollout" | Gradually enabling a feature for more users over time | Implemented via percentage-based rules |

## üîÆ 8. Next Steps & Further Reading

- **Additional Features to Consider**:
  - Implement scheduled activations and deactivations
  - Add support for numeric and string flag values (not just boolean)
  - Create a user interface for flag management
  - Integrate with analytics to measure feature impact

- **Practice Challenges**:
  - Add support for OR logic in rule conditions (currently only AND is supported)
  - Implement flag "stickiness" so users consistently get the same experience
  - Create a flag import/export mechanism for environment promotion
  - Add support for flag categories or tags for better organization
