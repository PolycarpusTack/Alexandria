# ADR-001: Microkernel Plugin Architecture

## Status
**Accepted** - 2025-01-11

## Context

The Alexandria Platform needs to support multiple specialized functionalities (crash analysis, log visualization, AI-assisted coding, etc.) while maintaining:
- System modularity and separation of concerns
- Easy extensibility for new features
- Independent development and deployment of components
- Clear separation between core platform and plugin functionality

Traditional monolithic architectures would make the system difficult to maintain and extend, while a pure microservices approach would add unnecessary complexity for a single-team project.

## Decision

We will implement a **microkernel architecture** where:

### Core System Responsibilities
- Plugin lifecycle management (install, activate, deactivate, uninstall)
- Event bus for inter-plugin communication
- Shared services (data access, authentication, logging)
- UI framework and routing
- Configuration management
- Security and permissions

### Plugin Responsibilities
- Specific business logic (crash analysis, log visualization, etc.)
- Plugin-specific UI components
- Data models and repositories
- API endpoints (registered with core)
- Event handlers and publishers

### Implementation Details

```typescript
// Plugin Interface
interface Plugin {
  manifest: PluginManifest;
  install(): Promise<void>;
  activate(): Promise<void>;
  deactivate(): Promise<void>;
  uninstall(): Promise<void>;
  getHealth(): Promise<PluginHealth>;
}

// Core Services Available to Plugins
interface PluginContext {
  dataService: DataService;
  eventBus: EventBus;
  logger: Logger;
  apiRegistry: APIRegistry;
  uiRegistry: UIRegistry;
  configService: ConfigService;
}
```

### Plugin Structure
```
src/plugins/[plugin-name]/
├── plugin.json          # Manifest
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts         # Plugin entry point
│   ├── services/        # Business logic
│   ├── repositories/    # Data access
│   └── api/            # API endpoints
├── ui/                  # React components
├── __tests__/          # Tests
└── docs/               # Documentation
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Modularity**: Clear separation between core and plugins
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features as plugins
- **Maintainability**: Isolated codebases reduce coupling
- **Team Productivity**: Different team members can work on different plugins
- **Testing**: Plugins can be tested in isolation
- **Deployment**: Plugins can be enabled/disabled without system restart

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Additional abstraction layer
- **Performance**: Small overhead from plugin system
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand plugin architecture
- **Event Dependencies**: Potential for complex event dependencies between plugins

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive plugin development documentation
- Shared utilities and base classes to reduce boilerplate
- Event bus monitoring and debugging tools
- Clear plugin lifecycle and dependency management
- Automated testing for plugin interactions

## Implementation Status

- ✅ Core plugin registry implemented
- ✅ Plugin lifecycle management
- ✅ Event bus system
- ✅ Shared services (data, auth, logging)
- ✅ UI registration system
- ✅ Alfred plugin (AI-assisted coding)
- ✅ Hadron plugin (crash analysis)
- ✅ Heimdall plugin (log visualization)
