# Alexandria QA Quick Start & TypeScript Error Fix

This directory contains scripts to quickly fix common TypeScript errors encountered when building the Alexandria platform and start the QA environment.

## What This Fixes

The quick fix scripts address the following issues:

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Installs the following packages:
   - `@elastic/elasticsearch` - Required for Log Visualization plugin
   - `@radix-ui/react-tooltip` - Required for UI components
   - `multer` - Required for file upload functionality
   - `@types/multer` - TypeScript definitions for multer

2. **Temporary Type Definitions**: Creates temporary TypeScript definition files for packages with missing or incomplete types.

3. **TypeScript Configuration**: Updates the TypeScript configuration to handle the temporary type definitions.

4. **Environment Setup**: Creates a development environment file if it doesn't exist.

## Quick Start (Recommended)

For the easiest experience, use the unified quick start script that fixes TypeScript errors and then starts the QA environment:

### On Linux/macOS:

```bash
# Make the script executable if needed
chmod +x qa-quick-start.js

# Run the unified script
./qa-quick-start.js
```

### On Windows:

```batch
# Run the batch file
qa-quick-start.bat
```

## Individual Scripts

If you prefer to run the steps separately:

### On Linux/macOS:

```bash
# Make the script executable if needed
chmod +x fix-typescript-errors.js

# Run the fix script
./fix-typescript-errors.js

# After running the script, try building the project again
node start-qa.js
```

### On Windows:

```batch
# Run the fix batch file
fix-typescript-errors.bat

# After running the script, try building the project again
node start-qa.js
```

## Manual Steps

If the script doesn't fully resolve your issues, you may need to take these additional steps:

1. **Install Additional Dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   npm install --save package-name
   ```

2. **Fix Interface Implementations**: 
   - Check for interface implementation mismatches
   - Ensure all required methods are implemented properly

3. **Rebuild Everything from Scratch**:
   ```bash
   # Clean up build artifacts
   rm -rf dist
   
   # Reinstall dependencies
   npm ci
   
   # Fix rollup issues
   node fix-rollup.js
   
   # Build the project
   npm run build
   ```
