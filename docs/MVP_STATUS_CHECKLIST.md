   - [ ] Add metrics collection for performance monitoring
   - [ ] Improve error handling for plugin initialization edge cases

2. **Crash Analyzer Plugin**
   - [ ] Add export functionality for analysis results
   - [ ] Implement batch processing for multiple logs
   - [ ] Enhance analysis accuracy with improved prompts

3. **Testing**
   - [ ] Increase test coverage to 80%+
   - [ ] Add performance tests for LLM integration
   - [ ] Implement stress tests for concurrent uploads

4. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Complete API reference documentation
   - [ ] Create tutorial videos for common workflows
   - [ ] Document deployment procedures for production

## Next Steps for Additional Features

After completing the Core + Crash Analyzer MVP, the planned development sequence should continue with:

1. **Log Visualization Plugin** - Design and implement the log visualization features
2. **AI-Driven Ticket Analysis Plugin** - Build ticket analysis capabilities
3. **Knowledge Base (RAG) Plugin** - Create the intelligent knowledge base system
4. **Cross-Plugin Workflows** - Implement integration between plugins

## Conclusion

The Alexandria platform has successfully implemented the core microkernel architecture and the Crash Analyzer plugin as the first MVP. The platform demonstrates the intended design patterns and provides a stable foundation for future plugin development.

The basic functionality for analyzing crash logs using local LLMs is working correctly, and the testing infrastructure provides confidence in the code quality. With a few remaining items to address, the Core + Crash Analyzer MVP is nearly ready for initial deployment to users.
